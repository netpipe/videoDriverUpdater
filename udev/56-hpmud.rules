# HPLIP udev rules file. Notify console user if plugin support is required for this device.
# SUSE changed:
#
# Exchanged the rule to GOTO hpmud_usb_rules if SUBSYSTEM is "usb"
# with the rule if SUBSYSTEM is "ppdev" to avoid that the "ppdev" rule
# is needlessly processed when SUBSYSTEM is "usb".
#
# Added GOTO hpmud_rules_end rule to skip the hpmud_usb_rules
# if SUBSYSTEM is not "usb" or if ENV{DEVTYPE} is not "usb_device" or if SUBSYSTEM is not "ppdev"
# to avoid that the hpmud_usb_rules are needlessly processed.
#
# The rule to automatically "add the printer and install plugin" is disabled
# because automated installation of non-free proprietary third-party software
# (here the plugin from HP) should not happen and it can cause whatever kind
# of strange behaviour see for example https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1197416
# and https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1221348
# while in contrast manual printer setup via hp-setup usually "just works"
# and it is clear for the user what goes on and in case of failure what went wrong.
#
# Because the rule to automatically "add the printer and install plugin"
# is also used to upload firmware into printers that need it
# see https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1220628
# a rule that only uploads firmware into printers that need it is added.
