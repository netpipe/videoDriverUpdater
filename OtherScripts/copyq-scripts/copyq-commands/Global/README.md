### [Snippets](snippets.ini)

Shows dialog with snippets to paste.

Snippets are loaded from "Snippets" tab. Item notes are used as snippet name.

Items can contain placeholders like:
- `${Name}` (default text is empty),
- `${Name:value}` (default text is "value"),
- `${Name:value1,value2,value3}` (default text is "value1"; allows to select from multiple values),
- `${Name:\n}` (multi-line text field).

When such snippet is selected, user is prompted to replace these placeholders with custom content.

To create your first snippet:

1. create "Snippets" tab (Ctrl+T),
2. add new item (Ctrl+N) with a snippet:

    You picked ${Fruit:apples,oranges,pears}!

3. set optional snippet name (Ctrl+F2), e.g. "Fruit".

Triggering the Snippets command (with a global shortcut) will show a simple
dialog where you can pick the snippet by its name.

To pick different tab name, you have to change the command's code.

    var snippetsTabName = '&Snippets'
